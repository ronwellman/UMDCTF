# UMDCTF

This is a quick repo I'm throwing together to attempt to capture some of my thoughts during the UMBCTF on 18APR2020.  I am a complete newbie when it comes to these things so don't expect to get a ton of wisdom from me.

I wish I was better at OSINT :(

I googled this hash which took me to the (UMD-CSEC github profile)[https://github.com/UMD-CSEC].  The repository only shows a single markdown document but the description has the hash so I know I'm in the right place.  I then noticed that there are 3 commits.  The second commit shows that a flag was added.  Clicking on the commit, I see that this commit has a binary file *.lol.jpg*.  I click Browse Files and the filename, I am shows a jpg that has the flag on it:  UMBDCTF-{meme_ch4llenges_ftw}
